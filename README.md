### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle Competition


The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. 
Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.  

The goal of this challenge is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a passenger will survive or not. 
The dataset provides passenger information such as - name, ticket class, age, sex, number of siblings, ticket number, passenger fare, etc.
 
 ## Result -
 Ranked 855 of about 14,000 teams.  
 Achieved accuracy score of 79%.
